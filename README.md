# Stabilized-Fitness-Time-Lapse
This repo contains the python code for taking pictures of a person in the same position everytime. 
This solves the problem of fitness progress recording, where each photo is taken in slightly different positions, thus generating a shaky time-lapse. Here we're using Google's Mediapipe in order to get the pose of the person, and then assuring that every picture is taken using the same pose, producing a much smoother final result. 
This code may also be used for aging time-lapse, hair growth time-lapse, or virtually any kind of time-lapse where the main subject is a human.
