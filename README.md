# Stabilized Fitness Time Lapse

This repo aims to solve the frustrating problem of taking pictures of yourself to register your gains as a time lapse, only to discover that all your photos are slightly different from each other and the video will be all messy. 
Using Mediapipe we'll make sure that every picture taken is in the same position, this way we'll have a very smooth time-lapse.
